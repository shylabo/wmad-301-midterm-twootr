# Routing in React Part 2

There is only 1 exercise per topic.

## Link:

Create a simple website with two pages - "Home" and "About." Add navigation links using the `<Link>` component that allow users to switch between these two pages.

## NavLink:

Build a navigation menu for your website with three sections - "Products," "Services," and "Contact." Use the `<NavLink>` component to highlight the currently active link in the menu as users navigate between these sections. Use any styling method.

## useParams:

Develop a simple recipe app. Create a route for individual recipes, and use the `useParams` hook to display the recipe details. You can have a list of recipes, and when a user clicks on one, it should show the details on a new page. You can hard code the recipe data.

## useNavigate:

Build a basic sign-up form for your website. After successful form submission, use the `useNavigate` hook to navigate to a "Welcome" page that thanks the user for signing up. Hint: Use time intervals to mock the behavior.

## redirect:

Create a login page and a "Dashboard" page. If a user is not logged in, use the `<Redirect>` component to send them to the login page. Once they log in, they should be redirected back to the Dashboard. You can use a hard coded boolean state.

## Nested Routes:

Develop a simple shopping website with categories and products. Implement `nested routes` for categories and individual product pages. Users should be able to click on a category and see the list of products within that category. Choose any data of your choice.
